An event that changed my perspective was when my grandfather passed away. Up until that point, I had taken for granted the time I spent with him. I had always thought that he would be there for me forever. After he passed away, I realized that life is precious and you should never take anyone for granted. I also learned that you should always make the most of the time you have with the people you love because you never know when their time might be up. Since my grandfather's death, I have made a point to spend more time with my family and to cherish the time we have together. I have also made a point to live my life in a way that would make him proud.
