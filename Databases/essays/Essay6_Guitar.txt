When I was younger, I would watch my father play the guitar and I was fascinated by it. I would watch his fingers gracefully move up and down the fretboard and I knew that I wanted to learn how to play the guitar. I started taking guitar lessons when I was in middle school and I loved it. I would spend hours practicing and I loved the feeling of playing a song and making people happy. I continued to play the guitar in high school and I started to play in a band. We would play at local bars and I loved the feeling of playing in front of a crowd. I also started to write my own songs and I loved the feeling of putting my thoughts and feelings into music. I am now a graduating senior and I continue to play the guitar. I love the feeling of playing a song and making people happy. I also love the feeling of writing my own songs and putting my thoughts and feelings into music. I am grateful that I have the opportunity to play the guitar and I am excited to see what the future holds for me as a musician.
