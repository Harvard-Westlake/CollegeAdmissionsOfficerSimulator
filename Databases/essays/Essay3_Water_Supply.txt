How I Saved My Town’s Water Supply From the Communist Threat
	When I was 10, I received the news from my parents: my dad was infertile. I knew instantly that there was only one cause of this: the Soviet Union. Five years ago, my Argentinian friend’s dad, Rudy Hess II, introduced me to the John Birch Society. Of course, I was initially skeptical of the claims of an overarching socialist threat. However, when my kindergarten teacher mentioned to my class that they need to socialize with each other more, I knew the very soul of our country was at stake. Knowing this truth, I had waited for years, but now I was ready. I shouted, harassed, and cajoled my neighbors, trying to tell them the truth. Unfortunately, however, the communists had brainwashed them too using microchips in the water. Eventually, my brainwashed cringe liberal cuck soyjack parents took me to see “psychologist” who told me I suffered from “severe psychosis” (being based) and “paranoia.” Now, at this point, all hope seemed lost. I was about to be sent to a mental hospital and my parents were doing nothing to support me. But then something miraculous happened. Now, I’ve never believed in ghosts (I’ve always thought they were a socialist plot to have us fund stupid Marxist propaganda like “national cemeteries”), but that night, I heard the voice of Robert Welch Jr. himself speak to me. “My child, the communists have poisoned the well by your house. Go forth and use your founding father given rights to bear arms to throw a grenade into the local well.” I was finally ready to do what I needed. I rummaged through my dad’s old war memorabilia and sprinted outside, pulled the pin, and dropped it down the well. First silence, then there was a booming that would have only ever been heard on the fourth of July. As I began to pass out from exhaustion, I saw the smiling face of Uncle Sam himself and grinned knowing that my dad would become fertile again someday.
