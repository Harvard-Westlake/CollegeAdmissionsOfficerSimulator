Ever since I was a young boy, I knew I was destined to be a footballer. From the moment I turned four, catching a ball stopped being an insurmountable challenge and instead became like second nature to me. One day, my father saw this and had one of the most excited smiles on his face that I have ever seen. “You’re the most athletic four year old I’ve ever seen!” He told me as he signed me up for the local football team. I was instantly hooked. I would toss the ball across the field, having my wide receiver catch the ball just before he was tackled. I felt amazing. While I wasn’t always enthusiastic, my father would always encourage me, yelling at me that I was a far stronger football player than he could have ever been. I remember all the crying that would ensue when my team lost in the playoffs, but the determination I was filled with encouraged me to keep going and play football next year. And at the end of the day, I would always realize (with much reinforcement from my father) that football was my true calling and that how strong I felt made any sort of struggle worth it.
