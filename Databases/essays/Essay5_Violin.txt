When I was younger, I always loved going to my grandparents house. My grandmother would always have the stereo on, playing Italian operas. I would sit and watch her sing along with the characters on the screen. My grandfather would be in the kitchen cooking, and I would hear him whistling along to the music. It was always so beautiful and I knew that I wanted to create that same feeling for others. That's why I became a musician. I started playing the violin when I was six years old and I haven't stopped since. Music has the ability to bring people together and create emotions that words can't describe. When I'm playing the violin, I feel like I'm a part of something bigger than myself. I'm connecting with people all over the world, and I'm sharing my love for music with them. Playing the violin isn't always easy. There are times when I'm frustrated or I don't feel like practicing. But I always remind myself why I started playing in the first place. I think about my grandparents and how much joy music brings to them. I think about the people who have told me that my playing has touched their lives. Music is my passion and I'm grateful to be able to share it with the world.
