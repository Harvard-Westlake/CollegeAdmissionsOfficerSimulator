	Ever since I was a young girl, I knew I was destined to be a gymnast. From the moment I turned four, the monkey bars on the playground stopped being an insurmountable challenge and instead became like second nature to me. One day, my mother saw this and had one of the most excited smiles on her face that I have ever seen. “You’re the most graceful four year old I’ve ever seen!” She told me as she signed me up for gymnastics practice. I was instantly hooked. I would spin and twirl on the bars, flipping off of the balance beam, touching down just in time. I felt amazing. While I wasn’t always enthusiastic, my mother would always encourage me, yelling at me that I was a far more nimble dancer than she could have ever been. I remember all the crying that would ensue when I came in fourth place in my school’s gymnastics competition, but the determination I was filled with encouraged me to keep going. And at the end of the day, I would always realize (with much reinforcement from my mother) that gymnastics was my true calling and that how graceful I felt made any sort of struggle worth it.
