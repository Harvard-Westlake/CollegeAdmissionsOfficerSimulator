Going into the military I had a very black and white view of the world. I was raised with the mentality that there are good guys and bad guys, and I was going to be the good guy. I was na√Øve and I thought that if I joined the military and followed the orders of those in charge, then I would be helping to create a world where good guys won and bad guys lost. I quickly learned that the world is not so simple. There are a lot of different perspectives and a lot of different ways to look at any given situation. My time in the military taught me to be more open-minded, to listen to other people's perspectives, and to try to understand why someone might see things a different way. My time in the military also taught me about leadership. I learned that a good leader is someone who can take into account all of the different perspectives and come up with a plan that everyone can agree on. I also learned that a good leader is someone who is willing to put the needs of the team before their own needs. I think my time in the military has helped me to become a better leader, and I hope to continue to develop my leadership skills in the future. The military has also taught me about discipline and teamwork. I learned that in order to be successful, I need to be able to work with others and follow orders. I also learned that I need to be able to stay calm under pressure and make quick decisions. These are all skills that I can use in the future, whether I am working on a team or in a leadership position. Overall, my time in the military has changed my perspective on the world. I am now more open-minded and I understand that there are many different ways to look at any given situation. I have also learned about leadership, discipline, and teamwork, which I can use in the future. I am grateful for the opportunities that the military has given me, and I am excited to see what the future holds.
